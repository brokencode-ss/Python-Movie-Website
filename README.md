# Python-Movie-Website
Udacity Python Nanodegree Course Project

**About**

This project is the end result of a Python Nanodegree Course offered by Udacity. It is a movie trailer website where clicking on the movie's poster plays the movie trailer in a small window on the same page.

**Information about the files**

1) The file fresh_tomatoes.py contains the open_movies_page() function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.

2) The file media.py contains a class Movie that encapsulates the different properties of a movie like its title, storyline, poster-image, the Youtube trailer URL and a function show_trailer() to open the trailer in the browser.

3) The file entertainment_center.py contains instances of the class movie and their constructors. It also consists of a call to function open_movies_page() which needs a parameter i.e. a list of all the instances created.

**How to run the project**

1)Download all the files in a single folder on your PC.

2)Open the file entertainment_center.py in a Python Editor.

3)Run the file using F5.
